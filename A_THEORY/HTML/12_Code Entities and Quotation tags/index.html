    <!-- Code Tag -->
    <h1>Code Tag</h1>
    <pre><code>  
#This is a python code
print("Hello World") <p></p>
     </code></pre>
    <!-- The <pre> tag is used to display text exactly as it is written in the HTML file, preserving spaces, tabs, and line breaks. However, it cannot directly display text that includes characters like < or > unless they are escaped using HTML entities like &lt; and &gt;. -->
    <!-- Entities -->
    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>

    <p>
      HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you
      to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily
      available on the keyboard. In this blog, we'll explore what HTML entities
      are, their types, and how to use them.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that
      the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with
      a semicolon (;).
    </p>
    <h2>Common HTML Entities</h2>
    <pre><code>
&amp;lt; for &lt;
&amp;gt; for &gt;
&amp;amp; for &amp;
&amp;nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&amp;copy; for &copy;
    </code></pre>

    <h1>HTML Quotation Tag</h1>

      They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for
      search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content.

    <p>Both of the follwing tags serve to define quotations in HTML</p>

    <q> <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> is used for shorter, inline quotes</q>

    </blockquote>
